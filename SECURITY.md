# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest major version is supported with security updates. It can be changed if many people are relying on a specific version for some reason. If this is the case, welcome to file an issue.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please contact yangjvn@126.com to report a vulnerability or change request.

- If the vulnerability in question affects common use cases, it will be treated as a bug and fixed very soon (typically within 1 week).
- Otherwise, it'll be scheduled in the same priority of feature request (which is lower than bugs).
- If the request is declined, you'll receive a reply email anyway (most likely there will be a discussion).
